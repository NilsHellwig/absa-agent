      "{\"summary\": \"Customer reviews for L'Osteria in Regensburg are mixed, but generally lean positive. Many reviewers (especially recent ones) praise the **delicious pizza, large portions (often XXL), friendly and attentive service, and lively atmosphere**. Several specifically recommend the Barbecue Chicken pizza. A recurring theme is that it's a great place to go with friends and families. \\n\\nHowever, there are consistent complaints about the **restaurant being very crowded, noisy, and tightly packed**, making it difficult to have a quiet conversation. Some reviewers have experienced **slow or inattentive service**, and a few noted a decline in pizza quality over time – specifically mentioning less generous toppings and dryness. There are also a few isolated complaints about long wait times for food and bills. Accessibility is a concern, as the restrooms are not easily accessible for those with mobility issues.\\n\\nSeveral reviews also mention that L'Osteria is a popular chain and can be found in multiple cities, with varying experiences across locations. A few reviews are unrelated to L'Osteria Regensburg, discussing Italian food in general or other restaurants.\", \"overall_sentiment\": \"Generally positive, with caveats about crowding and potential quality inconsistencies.\", \"praise\": [\"Delicious pizza\", \"Large portions\", \"Friendly and attentive service\", \"Lively atmosphere\", \"Good value for money\"], \"complaints\": [\"Crowded and noisy\", \"Tight seating\", \"Slow/inattentive service (sometimes)\", \"Declining pizza quality (less toppings, dryness)\", \"Accessibility issues (stairs to restrooms)\", \"Long wait times (occasionally)\"]}\n",

Well, my suggestion in my first reply don't serve pizzas. IMO the best neapolitan pizza is eaten at NineOfive, but they don't serve pasta. As you are looking for pizza AND pasta, maybe check L'Osteria or (a bit outside the centre) Restaurant Valentino.\",\n",

Ich habe ne Pizza Schinken bestellt, Menge des Belags hat in den letzten Monaten / Jahren stetig abgenommen, aber mittlerweile bekommt man gewürfelten Schinken wie vom Discounter und man hat gerade mal knapp zwei Esslöffel voll auf der ganzen Pizza! Da hilft auch nix das die so groß ist und auf keinen Teller passt! Als nächstes kommen die Dosen Pilze auf der Fungi , top die Wette gilt! Aber man soll ja nicht meckern, dafür lacht mich die Vanessa Mai an auf der Packung, jetzt weiß ich wo das Geld hin kommt bzw. mein Belag, die hat nämlich ordentlich was drauf auf der Pizza, traurig!

       "  'review_text': 'Wir waren zu Viert dort zu Gast und erlebten gleich zu Beginn um 18:30 Uhr eine Unsitte, die immer mehr um sich greift. Obwohl wir einen Tisch reserviert hatten und noch reichlich Auswahl war, bekamen wir einen Tisch zugewiesen, den man allenfalls als Katzentisch bezeichnen kann. Auf unsere Bitte nach einem anderen Tisch wurden wir in die Mitte des Raumes platziert, obwohl ein Tisch noch am Fenster frei war (und es noch bis nach 20:00 Uhr blieb). Zum Restaurant: viel zu klein, dadurch viel zu eng bestuhlt. Die Bedienung rempelte ständig an meinen Stuhl, obwohl ich mich dicht an den Tisch setzte. Eine Entschuldigung blieb natürlich aus. Auch der Versuch, etwas an der Beengtheit zu ändern. Der Kochbereich ist offen und so strömen alle Koch- und Essensgerüche ungehindert in den Gastraum, was dann für stark riechende Kleidung im Anschluss sorgt. Der Gastraum selbst spottet jeglicher Beschreibung: man will einerseits „authentisch italienisch“ sein, sorgt aber mit billiger Dekoration für das Gegenteil. Das mag vielleicht die anspruchslose Hautevolee begeistern. Gemütlichkeit für einen schönen Abend geht aber anders. Dafür ist der Gastraum zu laut und zu beengt.Zum Essen: viel zu teuer. Die Portionen waren für ein Abendessen ideal, nicht zu groß und nicht zu mächtig. Aber der Preis war fast schon unverschämt. Ich hatte eine Steinpilzsuppe vorweg und danach Gnocchi. Beides war in Ordnung, eine kulinarische Herausforderung war es allerdings nicht. Zur Vorspeise wurde uns zu Viert jeweils eine Scheibe Brot zugedacht. Die Weine waren akzeptabel, jedoch auch hier zu teuer. Die Flasche Wasser wurde nicht am Tisch geöffnet sondern kam bereits ohne Verschluss an unseren Tisch. Was mich immer skeptisch macht. Zum Service: viel zu patzig. Wir wurden von zwei jungen Frauen bedient, die höchst wahrscheinlich nicht geschultes oder gar ausgebildetes Gastronomie-Personal ist. Zuerst wurden wir mehrfach ungeduldig von einer Bedienung zur Bestellung aufgefordert. Dann wurde von der anderen Bedienung serviert. Und das in einer ausgesuchten Pampigkeit und Herablassung, dass sich dies natürlich bei mir auch in der Trinkgeldgabe äußerte. Ich gab keines. Auf den Abschiedsgruß aus unserer Gruppe wurde noch nicht einmal reagiert.Fazit: wer solche Preise für Essen und Service verlangt, sollte auch entsprechendes bieten. Was in diesem Lokal allerdings nicht geboten wird. Für ähnliches Geld, vielleicht ein wenig mehr, kann man auf Spitzenniveau in einem Sterne-Restaurant im Turm mit Terrasse und Domblick speisen und erhält dafür noch einen Spitzenservice von topp ausgebildetem und zuvorkommendem Personal. Die „Osteria Federico Secondo“ wird mich als Gast jedenfalls nicht mehr sehen.',\n",
