Instructions:
1. The page is relevant if it contains user-generated reviews, numerical ratings, or narrative feedback about the target subject (e.g., Restaurants in Regensburg).
2. It is ALSO relevant if it describes one specific target entity in depth, even if it is not a collective list.
3. It is NOT relevant if it is a general corporate entry, a tool page without review content, or completely unrelated to the query.
4. Output your decision as 'is_relevant' (true or false).
